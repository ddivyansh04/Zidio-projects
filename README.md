## üìÅ Projects Overview

### 1. Image Captioning and Image Segmentation

This project combines two important tasks in computer vision:

- **Image Captioning**: Generating natural language descriptions for input images using deep learning models such as CNN+LSTM and Transformer-based architectures.
- **Image Segmentation**: Identifying and labeling each pixel in an image using models like U-Net or Mask R-CNN.

**Key Highlights:**
- Implementation of caption generation and segmentation models
- Use of COCO / Pascal VOC datasets
- Optional deployment using Streamlit or Flask

**Tech Stack:**
- Python, TensorFlow / PyTorch
- OpenCV, NLTK / spaCy
- Flask / Streamlit


### 2. Stock Market Forecasting using Time Series Analysis

This project aims to analyze and forecast stock market trends using classical and deep learning time series models. The analysis covers data preprocessing, visualization, and predictive modeling.

**Models Used:**
- ARIMA, SARIMA (using `statsmodels`)
- Prophet (by Facebook)
- LSTM (using TensorFlow/Keras)

**Key Highlights:**
- Real-world stock datasets from Yahoo Finance or Kaggle
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Performance evaluation and comparison of models

**Tech Stack:**
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Prophet, Keras
- Streamlit / Flask (optional for deployment)
